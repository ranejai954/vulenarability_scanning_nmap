# vulenarability_scanning_nmap
This repository contains a collection of Nmap scripts and associated resources designed for comprehensive vulnerability scanning.The project leverages the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to identify common vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security weaknesses within target networks and systems.

# Features:
1.Service and Version Detection: Utilizes Nmap's robust service and version detection capabilities to accurately identify running services and their respective versions.

2. Vulnerability Detection: Employs a range of NSE scripts, including vuln, vulners, and custom scripts, to detect known vulnerabilities associated with identified services.

3. Configuration Analysis: Includes scripts for identifying common misconfigurations that could lead to security compromises.

4. Detailed Reporting: Generates comprehensive scan reports, providing actionable insights into discovered vulnerabilities and potential remediation steps.

5. Customizable Scans: Allows for flexible customization of Nmap commands and NSE script selections to tailor scans to specific requirements.

# Usage:
The repository provides instructions for executing Nmap scans with the included scripts, demonstrating how to target specific hosts or networks and interpret the scan results.
